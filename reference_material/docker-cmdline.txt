Docker Commands Feb 17/2020: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcxbHkqzJuI&list=PLVmRRBrc2pRCMoXe30tnc3mqY6wBBu3z8&index=3&t=0s)

docker run [IMAGE NAME] [START CMD]
docker search [TEXT]
docker pull [IMAGE RUN] - download to local image repository
docker images - show available images
docker ps - show existing container information 
docker start -a [HASH] - attach the stdout of the docker container to the current executing terminal
docker run -it [IMAGE NAME] [START CMD] - log in with a 'interactive terminal' to the container
    ex/ docker run -it alpine sh
docker exec [CMD] [CONTAINER HASH] - runs the command on a running container

docker stop / kill

docker create - creates a container with default /bin/sh

docker run --name SKEMPERMAN_CONTAINER to name a new container

run vs create vs start

    - run attempts an image pull (download) from registry if it doesn't exist (all-inclusive)
    - create also pulls an image, but just creates the container, doesn't actually run the container???!?!?!
    - start obviously 'runs' a command on an existing (active) container, but doesn't pull or anything
