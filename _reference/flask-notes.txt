* Startup hints from offical quickstart tutorial ---
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development/production
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 for publicly accessible server (listen on all public IPs, otherwise local only by default)

* You can handle uploaded files with Flask easily. Just make sure not to forget to set the enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute on your HTML form, otherwise the browser will not transmit your files at all.*
